## History
It's a static website written in HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. I was actively learning React when I was working on this website. At first, I wanted to build it with React but eventually, I decided to build it in vanilla Javascript to feel all the pain points of it and better understand all the value of React as a web development tool. 

## Concept
The solar system on the Home page symbolizes my career as a developer. Each planet is connected with its respective project in a navbar using JS functions. When you click on a project name (or its respective planet), the website hides the system and displays a section about that project.
